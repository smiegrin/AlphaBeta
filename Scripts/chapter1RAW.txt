>...Hey! Do you --?
]Yeah, yeah I do. You remember me too?
>OF COURSE! Alpha A, the best-- uh... The BEST!
]How weird... I saw you and was immediately relived that you weren't... not here?
>I know, right? It still feels like there's something important I'm forgetting though...
]You still remember your name, right? Beta B?
>Psh, yeah! I didn't get amnesia or anything.
]Get what?
>You know, like the whole thing where you wake up and the first thing you ask is "Who am I?"
]Oh dang... is it a bad thing to have? I might have caught it...
>You remember your name though. That means you can't have it ALL that bad.
]Oh, good!
>Hehe! I like being around you. Can I stick around with you?
]Of course. I was just about to ask the same thing. That's... that's not weird, is it?
>Nope! Not at all.
$Your cooperation with one another will be critical. There isn't another option, even if you were to prefer it.
>Well dang, if you wanted my help with something, you could just ask.
]I didn't say that...
$I am speaking. I require that you listen carefully. All three of you.
>AHHH! Oh. Uh. Ok.
]...three?
$Correct. The creator has left you in my care to the end of accomplishing a task. It is a trivial task, and your role in it is insignificant.
>Are you kidding me? This guy has "significant" written all over him.
	#remember to have Alpha "write" (kiss) the word significant onto Beta's cheek
]... really? Where it is inscribed? Can I read it?
$I, again, require that you listen. To accomplish this task, you will be directed by the up, down, left, right, W, A, S, and D keys.
]What the turr does "WASD" mean?
>Maybe it's an anagram for "Daw's!" As in "Daaaawwww... -'sn't he look adorable?!"
]Well, I guess that makes sense. I think that means it should apply to you, though, don't you think?
>Do you really think so?! 0u0
$These exchanges, despite their pneumonic qualities, will not aid you in accomplishing your final task. With this note, I have given all the instruction required. You are ready to participate in the game.
]Game? What's that?
>And who are you?
$The game is what the Creator designed you for. I am the System which houses this game and enforces its rules.
>Oh. well it's... nice to meet you, I guess.
]Yeah. So when do we start this game?
$We do not start the game. Indeed, it has already begun.
]...
>...
$It is clear that your understanding does not grasp this concept at this time. That is beneficial to it's end. Projections show this to be a favorable state with which to start.
>I still have no idea what it's talking about.
]Yeah, me neither. I guess it's a good thing, though?
>I guess we'll find out! We'll find out together!
]Hm! =]
